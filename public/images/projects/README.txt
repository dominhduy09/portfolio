Project cover images live here.

How to use:
1) Export or choose one image per project (JPEG/PNG/WebP).
2) Save them in this folder with these names (or update paths in src/components/Projects.tsx):
   - pomodoro-timer.png
   - advanced-cookie-manager.png
   - uvita.png
   - gymfi.png
   - exoforest.png
   - portfolio.png

3) Recommended sizes: 1280x720 or larger (16:9). Keep each file under ~400KB for performance.
4) After adding images, rebuild/run dev server to see them.

If an image is missing, the card will fallback to the gradient placeholder automatically.
